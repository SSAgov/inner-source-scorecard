# Inner Source Scorecard

How well your project is enabling collaboration and open source principles and practices within the agency? This is also know as"[Inner source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source)"...it's just a buzzword for following "open source" principles and practices within an organization:

* **Open Exchange** - We can learn more from each other when information is open. A free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas.
* **Participation** -When we are free to collaborate, we create. We can solve problems that no one person may be able to solve on their own.
* **Meritocracy** - In a meritocracy, the best ideas win. In a meritocracy, everyone has access to the same information. Successful work determines which projects rise and gather effort from the community.
* **Community** - Communities are formed around a common purpose. They bring together diverse ideas and share work. Together, a global community can create beyond the capabilities of any one individual. It multiplies effort and shares the work. Together, we can do more.

7. Better code quality
8. Better documentation of shadow IT

## How does your code score

* &gt;150pt Great Job! You are fostering an open project and encouraging collaboration across the agency!
* 100-150pts You're getting there; fostering an open project! Just a few more steps to encourage collaboration.
* &lt;100 You need a little work to be more open. Let us help you out
